I'm a web developer, mainly focused on the front-end (for the moment üßê), I've been in charge of developing professional websites for big companies giving them their presence on the web.

I am a problem solver, I am someone who believes that thanks to the internet you can learn to build and develop whatever you want and I say this because it is my case, everything I have learned has been through the internet and it has been possible thanks to being self-taught, organized and disciplined.

The technologies I have used, I didn't use them doing a course or watching videos, I used them building projects, because in my opinion is the best way to learn and understand how a technology works. Documentation is your best friend (sometimes).

I hope you liked what you have seen. If you want to work with me, don't be shy and send me a message by filling the <NuxtLink to="/contact">contact form</NuxtLink>.
