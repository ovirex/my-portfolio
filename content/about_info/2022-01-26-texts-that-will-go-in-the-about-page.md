I'm Ovidio Perez, web developer focused mainly in the front-end area (for the moment). With taste and focus on building solutions, as you can see in my project <NuxtLink to="/works/moG_M9wpKp-E">image link finder</NuxtLink>, I faced a problem, I developed a solution. I have worked developing professional websites for companies giving them an online presence, I have also been in charge of managing and supervising software development.

I really like the development of websites and software because of its thin barrier of limitations, if there is a problem there is a solution, and programming allows to create those solutions, whatever it is, most likely it is possible to build. Of course, always being willing to have the discipline and organization to learn constantly, as they say, being an "forever student", I stand by that.

I am currently working as a freelancer, but I am open to any interesting challenge or opportunity. If you are interested in contacting me, you can send me a message by filling out the <NuxtLink to="/contact">contact form</NuxtLink>.
