This markdown previewer project was one of my first times using a external library to achieve something. After some reading at the documentation of the 'marked' library I could build what I need.  

This process has helped me with other projects where I need to build something and I know I don't have to build it from scratch. After some research and some documentation reading, you will always find a library that will help you achieve your goal.
