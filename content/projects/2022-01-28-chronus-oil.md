Home designed and developed with the objective of being interactive and eye-catching without compromising the accessibility of the information with a fixed menu that keeps the main element of the brand present in the navigation. The home page was developed from scratch with good old HTML/CSS and JS. The rest of the sections were developed using Wordpress and Elementor since the client has the intention of publishing a blog.
