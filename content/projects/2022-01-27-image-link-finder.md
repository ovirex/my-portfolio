This code was developed with the goal in mind of saving me time searching for each author image in a JSON of quotes. That updated JSON with each author’s image was used in [other project](https://github.com/ovirex/random-quote-machine-fcc). My “laziness” made me make this code to avoid searching each image by myself and gave me the opportunity to learn a little bit of web scraping.
