A calculator developed using react. But it is worth mentioning that the function making the calculations is not some meta programming thing like `eval()`, in fact, I made my own function, that way I remove the possibility of running potential malicious code. 

You can use the calculator with the mouse or with the keyboard. You are open to choose.
