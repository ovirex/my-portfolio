A form developed for the optimization of the workflow of the company 911 Smartphones. It automates how customers get pricing information for some of the products available in the store. I developed 2 versions, one that uses [Node.js](https://github.com/ovirex/911-form) as the back-end to send the emails, the other uses [PHP](https://github.com/ovirex/formulario-911-php). The one in use is the one developed in PHP.
