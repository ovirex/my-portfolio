mariaescribe is a graphic designer that required a portfolio to show all her professional work. But she also needs to manage the website by herself. So thatâ€™s when I had the opportunity to use Nuxt.js to generate and host a static site in GithubPages. And to make her able to manage her site and projects I used Netlify CMS which allows me to give her a clean interface for her to be able to upload and manage her work.
